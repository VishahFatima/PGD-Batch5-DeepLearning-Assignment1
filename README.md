# Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to the Assignment 1 of my deep learning course completed as part of the Post Graduate Diploma in Data Science & AI at NED University of Engineering & Technology. The assignment covers topics like gradient descent & its types, Validation set & Validation Loss. It also includes the code for creating a MLP model step by step using tips data from Seaborn Library.

## Assignment Tasks
1. **Explore these topics**
   Gradient Descent & types of Gradient Descent
   Validation Set & Validation Loss
2. **MLP model using tips data from Seaborn Library**

## Usage
Each task is implemented as a separate Python script or Jupyter Notebook. Clone the repository and explore the solutions to enhance your understanding.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pgd-batch5-deeplerning-assignment1.git
